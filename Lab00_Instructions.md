### Using Comments in Your Code
In most every programming language (I don't know them all so I won't speak in absolutes) there exists comments. Comments are used so that we as programmers don't forget what our code does (This happens at an astounding frequency). When you write a comment python completely ignores anything typed after a `#` or within a set of `"""`. Below is a few examples.
```python
#this a single line comment

"""
this is the standard mult-
line comment
"""

'''
This also works as a multi-
line comment but is uglier subjectively
'''
```

## What to add in lab00.py
|Part|Topic|
|---|---|
|A|`print()`|
|B|Comments|
|C|Submission|

### Part A ~ `print()`
In your new `lab00.py` file, print out **"Hello World!"**.


### Part B ~ Comments
Next, add in some comments! Use **both** single and multi-line comments. 

Use the single line comment to describe what is going on with your code.

In a multi-line comment, write out your name and the date. 

### Part C ~ How To Submit

1. Go to your Terminal 
2. Navigate to your Lab Notebooks Repo (Remember, `cd` til you're there!)
3. Run the following sequence of commands
```bash
git add lab00.py
git commit -m "<insert message here>"
git push
```
4. Rejoice you've submitted your assignment

### (Optional) Extra for fun:
For some extra fun, make a multi-line comment that you think would make me and the TAs laugh! (please keep it appropriate tho)
